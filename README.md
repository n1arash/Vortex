Welcome To Vortex, The Void-Intelligence Artificial Cortex library for Neural Network and Deep Learning development. 

Vortex is built with the aim of allowing Deep-Learning researchers to test, and see the result of their new formulas in all aspects of the data-flow pipeline, without the need to read the source code. Researchers can write their custom functions / formulas for the currently developed features of the library:

- Activation
- Cost
- Layer
- Optimizer
- Regularization
